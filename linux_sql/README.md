# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
## Introduction:
- A Linux Cluster: is a connected array of Linux computers or nodes that work together and can be viewed and managed as a single system. Nodes are usually connected by fast LANs, with each node running its own instance of Linux. Nodes may be physical or virtual machines, and they may be separated geographically. Each node includes storage capacity, processing power and I/O (input/output) bandwidth. Multiple redundant nodes of Linux servers may be connected as a cluster for high availability (HA) and Faul tolerance  where each node is capable of failure detection and recovery.[Linux Cluster Definition](https://susedefines.suse.com/definition/linux-cluster/)
- A Monitoring Agent: is an intelligent application that observes the system resources and gathers data from  each node of the cluster about hardware spysifications and usage perfomance such as CPU utilization, Networking traffic, etc.
